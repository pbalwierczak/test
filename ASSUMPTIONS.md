# Production System Assumptions

This document outlines the assumptions and improvements that would be implemented in a production environment.

## Test Coverage
- On production app I would strive to achieve 80% code coverage, if realistic

## Event Handling

- **Kafka Security**: For demonstration purposes, Kafka is unsecured, but in production it would be properly secured
  - Only scooters would be authorized to post events (location updates, trip events)
  - Only the backend service would be authorized to consume events
  - Would implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Authentication & Security

- **Enhanced Authentication**: Scooter clients and user clients would have more robust authentication mechanisms
  - **Current**: Simple API key authentication (used for development simplicity)
  - **Production**: JWT tokens with proper token management
    - Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
