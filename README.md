## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (included in Docker setup)
- Apache Kafka 7.4+ (included in Docker setup)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

2. **Start the application** (includes database and Kafka):

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require API key authentication via the `Authorization` header, except for the health check endpoint.

### System
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Service health status (public endpoint)

### Scooter Management
- `GET /api/v1/scooters` - List scooters with geographic and status filtering
  - Query parameters: `status`, `min_lat`, `max_lat`, `min_lng`, `max_lng`, `limit`, `offset`
- `GET /api/v1/scooters/{id}` - Get specific scooter details
- `GET /api/v1/scooters/closest` - Find closest scooters by location
  - Query parameters: `lat`, `lng`, `radius`, `status`, `limit`


### API Documentation
- Interactive API docs: http://localhost:8080/docs
- OpenAPI specification: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/openapi.json

## Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses Kafka event-driven communication for real-time processing and scalability. The simulator communicates with the server exclusively through Kafka events.

### Kafka Events

The simulator publishes events to Kafka topics that are consumed by the server:

- **Trip Started**: `scooter.trip.started` - When a user begins a trip
- **Trip Ended**: `scooter.trip.ended` - When a trip is completed
- **Location Updated**: `scooter.location.updated` - Periodic location updates during trips

### Event Flow

1. **Simulator** â†’ Publishes events to Kafka topics
2. **Kafka** â†’ Stores and distributes events
3. **Server** â†’ Consumes events and processes them through existing services

### Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture

- **Decoupling**: Simulator and server operate independently
- **Scalability**: Multiple consumers can process events
- **Reliability**: Events are persisted and can be replayed
- **Observability**: Complete event flow visibility
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new event consumers

## Simulator System

The application includes a comprehensive simulator system for testing and development. The simulator creates realistic scooter and user behavior, including:

- **Scooter Simulation**: Multiple scooters with realistic movement patterns
- **User Simulation**: Virtual users starting and ending trips
- **Location Updates**: Periodic GPS updates during active trips
- **Event Publishing**: Real-time Kafka event publishing

### Quick Simulator Start

```bash
# Start the main application
make start-app

# Load sample data (required for simulator)
make seed

# Start the simulator (in another terminal)
make start-sim

# Monitor both services
make logs-app    # Application logs
make logs-sim    # Simulator logs
```

### Simulator Documentation

For detailed simulator setup, configuration, troubleshooting, and advanced usage, see the dedicated [SIMULATOR_SETUP.md](SIMULATOR_SETUP.md) documentation.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables. Create a `.env` file based on the example configuration.

### Key Configuration Areas
